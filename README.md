# Physics Lab Reports

This repository contains selected undergraduate physics laboratory reports from Tokyo University of Science. It is intended to showcase hands-on experimental work, analytical methods, and data presentation using LaTeX. The reports are organized by academic year and topic.

All reports are authored in LaTeX, and include both source code and compiled PDFs. A custom template is used throughout for consistency and academic clarity.
